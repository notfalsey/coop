# coop
This project includes the Arduino sketch and Fritzing schematic for a chicken coop controller.  The controller opens and shuts the door based on input from a photo resistor.  There is also a command handler to receive commands from a Raspberry Pi over the i2C pins.  The schematic does not include the i2c wiring yet.
